# ðŸ§  Memory Management Visualizer

A graphical simulation tool to visualize how operating systems manage memory. This project demonstrates concepts like **memory allocation**, **deallocation**, **fragmentation**, **paging**, **segmentation**, and **virtual memory** using dynamic, real-time visualizations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- ðŸ“¦ **Memory Allocation & Deallocation**  
  Visual representation of memory blocks as they are allocated and freed during process execution.

- ðŸ”€ **Paging & Segmentation Simulation**  
  Switch between paging and segmentation modes to see how each handles memory management.

- ðŸ§© **Memory Fragmentation Display**  
  Shows internal and external fragmentation dynamically.

- ðŸ§¬ **Virtual Memory Mapping**  
  Illustrates how virtual memory translates to physical memory using page tables or segments.

- ðŸ“Š **Statistics Panel**  
  Live stats showing memory usage, number of processes, fragmentation percentage, and more.
